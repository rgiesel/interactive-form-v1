# interactive-form-v1

The goal of this project is to use JavaScript and jQuery to enhance an
interactive form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."
Features include customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
User input is validated and error messages are displayed as necessary, with
one instance of a dynamic error message for an invalid email address.
Credit card number validation also provides one of two different error messages,
depending on user input.
